# Water-Valve-CAD-Model
This is a **3D model of a water valve**, created using **AutoCAD**. The model includes different parts of the valve, such as the **flanges, bolts, handle, and body**, designed with accurate shapes and sizes.  

## 🛠️ Features  
- **3D Design**: The valve is modeled in **three dimensions** with realistic details.  
- **Exploded View**: The parts are shown separately to understand how they fit together.  
- **Different Parts**: The valve includes **bolts, a handle, and a main body**, all created separately.  
- **Color & Materials**: Different colors are used to **make parts easy to identify**.
